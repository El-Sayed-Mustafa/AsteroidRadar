<h1>Asteroid Radar</h1>
<p>This is an Asteroid Radar application that uses NASA's NeoWs API, RESTful, Moshi, Picasso, Room database, Work Manager, ConstraintLayout, MVVM, Navigation, RecyclerView, and Filtering. The application allows users to view a list of asteroids that will pass near Earth on a specific date. The application uses NASA's NeoWs API to retrieve the asteroid data and displays it in a list using a RecyclerView. The user can filter the list by asteroid name or date. The application also uses Room database to save the asteroid data locally, and Work Manager to schedule updates. The application utilizes MVVM architecture and Navigation component for structuring the codebase. The application also uses Moshi for parsing the json response and Picasso for loading images. The layout is implemented using ConstraintLayout.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of NASA's NeoWs API, RESTful, Moshi, Picasso, Room database, Work Manager, ConstraintLayout, MVVM, Navigation, RecyclerView, and Filtering, as well as experience with building mobile apps.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Android Studio</li>
    <li>Kotlin</li>
<li>NASA's NeoWs API</li>
<li>RESTful</li>
<li>Moshi</li>
<li>Picasso</li>
<li>Room database</li>
<li>Work Manager</li>
<li>ConstraintLayout</li>
<li>MVVM</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>RecyclerView</li>
<li>Filtering</li>

</ul>
<h2>Installing</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/<username>/AsteroidRadar.git
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Open the project in Android Studio</li>
    <li>Build and run the application on an emulator or a physical device</li>
</ol>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The application has a user-friendly interface, with a list of asteroids that will pass near Earth on a specific date. The user can filter the list by asteroid name or date. The user can also view the details of an asteroid by clicking on it. The application uses NASA's NeoWs API to retrieve the asteroid data, and uses Room database to save the data locally, and Work Manager to schedule updates. The application utilizes MVVM architecture and Navigation component for structuring the codebase. The application also uses Moshi for parsing the json response and Picasso for loading images. The layout is implemented using ConstraintLayout.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>You need to register and get an API key from NASA's NeoWs API website to use the API and make requests to the API</p>
